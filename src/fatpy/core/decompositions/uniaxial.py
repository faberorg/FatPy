"""Uniaxial decompositions methods.

Implements algorithms designed to decompose one-dimensional signals into individual load
cycles, enabling detailed analysis of variable amplitude loading. By identifying turning
points and extracting cycles based on established criteria (e.g., rainflow counting),
they facilitate fatigue analysis, damage assessment, and other time-domain signal
evaluations.
