"""Shear Path Analysis 2D methods of multiaxial decompositions.

These methods are designed to evaluate the mean shear stress and shear stress amplitude
acting on a specified material plane, typically used in multiaxial fatigue analysis. By
projecting the stress tensor onto the plane of interest, they provide key parameters
for assessing crack initiation risks and fatigue life under complex loading paths.
