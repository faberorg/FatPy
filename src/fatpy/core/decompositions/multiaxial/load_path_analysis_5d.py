"""Load Path Analysis 5D methods of multiaxial decompositions.

These methods compute the amplitude (J_2,a) and mean (J_2,m) values of the second
invariant of the deviatoric stress tensor in five-dimensional deviatoric space. This
evaluation is particularly useful in advanced multiaxial fatigue models, where accurate
representation of cyclic loading paths and stress states in the deviatoric space is
critical for predicting material response.
