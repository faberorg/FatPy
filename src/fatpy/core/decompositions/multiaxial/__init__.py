"""Multiaxial decompositions methods.

These routines provide tools for decomposing multiaxial stress and strain states into
their individual components, such as normal and shear parts, principal values, and
others. They are essential for analyzing complex loading conditions, enabling accurate
evaluation of material behavior under multiaxial fatigue.
