"""Fatigue limit correction methods for the stress-life approach.

These routines calculate correction factors that modify the fatigue limit in an
S-N curve to account for real-world influences such as surface finish, size effect,
mean stress, residual stresses, temperature, and notches. By combining these empirical
correction models, adjusted endurance limits may be produced for component-level fatigue
prediction.
