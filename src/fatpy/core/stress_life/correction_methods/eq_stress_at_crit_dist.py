"""Equivalent stress at critical distance correction methods for stress-life approach.

These modules implement various Theory of Critical Distances (TCD)-based approaches for
stress-gradient correction, which improve fatigue strength predictions near stress
concentrators such as notches or cracks. By incorporating characteristic length
parameters, the methods account for the spatial distribution of stress and mitigate the
over-conservatism of local stress-based criteria, offering more accurate fatigue
assessments under both uniaxial and multiaxial loading conditions.
