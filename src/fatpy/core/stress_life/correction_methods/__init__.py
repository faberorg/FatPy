"""Correction methods for the stress-life.

These methods project how various factors—such as surface finish, size effect,
mean stress, residual stresses, temperature, manufacturing defects, and notch
geometry—modify the fatigue strength of a real component by quantifying shifts in the
S-N curve or fatigue limit.
