"""Damage parameters calculation methods for the stress-life approach.

These methods provide parameters for evaluating stress-based fatigue damage under
uniaxial or multiaxial loading conditions. They include critical plane and
invariant-based approaches, such as maximum principal stress, Findley's and Dang Van's
criteria, which relate the applied stress state to fatigue life by identifying the most
damaging stress components or orientations.
