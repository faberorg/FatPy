"""Multiaxial fatigue criteria methods for the stress-life approach.

These modules implement a range of criteria for assessing fatigue strength under
multiaxial stress states, addressing both proportional and non-proportional loading
paths. The implemented models include critical plane approaches, energy-based methods,
and stress invariants, enabling prediction of fatigue limits/strengths for complex
loading scenarios across various materials and geometries.
