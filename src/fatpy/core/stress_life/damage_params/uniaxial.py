"""Uniaxial fatigue criteria methods for the stress-life approach.

Contains criteria that address uniaxial high-cycle fatigue by incorporating the mean
stress effect through an equivalent stress amplitude approach. By adjusting the stress
amplitude to account for mean stress influences—using models such as Goodman, Gerber,
or Soderberg—they enable more accurate fatigue life predictions where mean stresses
significantly affect material endurance.
