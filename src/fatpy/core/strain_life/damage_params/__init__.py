"""Damage parameters calculation methods for the strain-life approach.

This module includes both uniaxial and multiaxial parameters for low-cycle fatigue
assessment, covering a range of strain-life-based damage models suitable for high
plastic strain regimes. It also incorporates methods based on the FKM Guideline,
enabling standardized evaluation of fatigue strength under complex loading conditions.
