"""Multiaxial fatigue criteria methods for the strain-life approach.

These methods perform low-cycle fatigue assessment using multiaxial damage parameters
that combine stress, strain, and mean stress effects into a single fatigue-relevant
quantity. By incorporating critical plane, invariant-based, and energy-based criteria,
they enable life prediction for components subjected to complex non-proportional
loading paths where significant plastic deformation occurs.
