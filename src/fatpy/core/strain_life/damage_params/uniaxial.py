"""Uniaxial fatigue criteria methods for the strain-life approach.

These methods compute uniaxial damage parameters used in strain-life (ε-N) analysis to
correlate cyclic strain amplitudes with fatigue life. They include parameters such as
Coffin-Manson, Morrow, and Smith-Watson-Topper (SWT), which combine elastic and plastic
strain components—and, when applicable, mean stress effects—into a single scalar value
for life prediction under uniaxial loading conditions.
