"""Elastic-Plastic Conversion methods for Strain-Life analysis.

These methods convert purely elastic stress or strain states into their elastic-plastic
equivalents to account for local yielding effects in fatigue or fracture assessments.
Using approaches such as Neuber's rule or Glinka's strain energy density method,
they provide corrected stress-strain values that better represent actual material
behavior under high local stresses, especially at notches or other stress concentrators.
