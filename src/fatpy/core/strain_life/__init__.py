"""Strain-based fatigue life analysis methods.

These methods perform fatigue analysis using the relationship between strain amplitude
and the number of cycles to failure, as expressed by strain-life (Îµ-N) approaches such
as the Coffin-Manson and Basquin laws. They are particularly suited for low-cycle and
transitional fatigue regimes, where plastic strain plays a significant role, enabling
life prediction under variable amplitude or multiaxial loading when combined with
appropriate mean stress corrections and cycle counting techniques.
