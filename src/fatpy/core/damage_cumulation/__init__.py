"""Damage cumulation module.

The module implements various fatigue damage accumulation rules used to estimate the
total damage under variable amplitude loading. They include both classical linear
models, such as Palmgren–Miner’s rule, and more advanced non-linear approaches that
account for load sequence effects, mean stress influence, and material-specific
behavior for improved fatigue life prediction.
