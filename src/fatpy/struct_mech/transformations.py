"""Transformations methods of structural mechanics.

These routines perform mathematical operations to transform stress and strain tensors
between different coordinate systems or reference frames. They include tensor rotation,
transformation to principal axes, and projection onto specified planes, enabling
detailed analysis of material response under complex loading conditions and supporting
criteria based on critical plane, invariant, or principal stress/strain approaches.
Includes 5D deviatoric stress reduction.
