A Python package for fatigue life evaluation of materials.

## Features

### Core Modules

- **Stress-Life** - Stress-based fatigue assessment methods for estimating fatigue damage with corrections for various effects (stress concentration, size, surface quality, etc.)
- **Strain-Life** - Fatigue analysis using strain amplitude and cycles to failure relationships (Îµ-N approaches) such as Coffin-Manson and Basquin laws, suited for low-cycle and transitional fatigue regimes
- **Energy-Life** - Fatigue analysis methods based on the relationship between strain energy density and number of cycles to failure
- **Damage Cumulation** - Various fatigue damage accumulation rules for variable amplitude loading, including linear models (Palmgren-Miner) and advanced non-linear approaches accounting for load sequence effects
- **Decompositions** - Methods for breaking down complex load signals into cycles, containing both uniaxial and multiaxial procedures
- **Plane-Based Methods** - Methods for processing stress tensor paths on material planes, providing infrastructure for critical-plane and integral prediction approaches

### Supporting Modules

- **Material Laws** - Functions dealing with various material constitutive laws and behavior models
- **Structural Mechanics** - Stress, strain analysis and transformation utilities
- **Utils** - General utilities for mesh handling, signal processing, and data manipulation
