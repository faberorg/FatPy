# FatPy

Welcome to FatPy, an open-source Python package for fatigue life evaluation of materials.

## :fontawesome-solid-circle-info: Introduction

FatPy is developed to assist researchers, engineers, and industry
professionals in accurately assessing material fatigue life. Its modular architecture is designed
to accommodate a variety of fatigue analysis methods, making it a versatile tool in the field of
material science.

### Key Features

#### Core Modules

- **Stress-Life**  
    Stress-based fatigue assessment methods for estimating fatigue damage with corrections for various effects (stress concentration, size, surface quality, etc.)
- **Strain-Life**  
    Fatigue analysis using strain amplitude and cycles to failure relationships (Îµ-N approaches) such as Coffin-Manson and Basquin laws, suited for low-cycle and transitional fatigue regimes
- **Energy-Life**  
    Fatigue analysis methods based on the relationship between strain energy density and number of cycles to failure
- **Damage Cumulation**  
    Various fatigue damage accumulation rules for variable amplitude loading, including linear models (Palmgren-Miner) and advanced non-linear approaches accounting for load sequence effects
- **Decompositions**  
    Methods for breaking down complex load signals into cycles, containing both uniaxial and multiaxial procedures
- **Plane-Based Methods**  
    Methods for processing stress tensor paths on material planes, providing infrastructure for critical-plane and integral prediction approaches

#### Supporting Modules

- **Material Laws**  
    Functions dealing with various material constitutive laws and behavior models
- **Structural Mechanics**  
    Stress analysis and transformation utilities
- **Utils**  
    General utilities for mesh handling, signal processing, and data manipulation

## :fontawesome-solid-download: Installation

=== "Using pip"

    Install from PyPI via pip

    ```bash
    pip install fatpy
    ```

=== "Using uv"

    Faster installation from PyPI

    ```bash
    uv pip install fatpy
    ```
    ??? tip
        To install package and add dependency to your project .toml file use:

        ```bash
        uv add fatpy # Install from PyPI and add dependency 
        ```

For detailed installation options, see the [Installation Guide :octicons-arrow-right-24:](development/install.md)

## The FABER Project

!!! abstract "Background"
    FatPy is a key initiative of Working Group 6 (WG6) within the FABER (Fatigue Benchmark Repository) project,
    operating under COST Action CA23109. The FABER project aims to create a comprehensive database of
    experimental fatigue data to enhance the accuracy of fatigue life predictions.

Working Group 6 is specifically focused on developing open-source fatigue software, with FatPy being
a flagship product of this endeavor.
