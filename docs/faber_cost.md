*"Enhancing Fatigue Prediction Through Collaboration"*

!!! abstract "Fatigue Benchmark Repository"
    FABER is a COST Action focused on creating a comprehensive fatigue data repository, enhancing prediction methods, and fostering collaboration among academia, industry, and developers for safer, cost-effective designs.

## About Us

FABER is committed to advancing fatigue research by fostering interdisciplinary collaboration. Our mission is to create open-access repositories of experimental data, computational tools, and standardized benchmarks that redefine engineering practices and enhance safety.

## Building the Future of Fatigue Analysis

The goal of the action presented in this project is to develop a global leading network of industry, academia and fatigue solver developers to build a fatigue benchmark repository that will allow all stakeholders to test the quality of fatigue prediction models and of their various implementations in either in-house software units or in purchased solvers.

This would enhance EU competitivity, reduce research poverty and deliver safer components for citizens. The project will demonstrate that benchmarking is possible, and what level of result quality can be achieved. To quicken the development, validation and application process of new criteria, new fatigue software tool enabling large scale validation processes is to be developed.

## Advantages of FABER COST

FABER COST offers significant benefits by creating a centralized fatigue data repository, improving prediction accuracy, and fostering collaboration across academia, industry, and developers. This initiative enhances the reliability and efficiency of fatigue analysis, ensuring safer, more cost-effective engineering solutions. By supporting open science, FABER drives innovation and modernizes fatigue life prediction methods.
