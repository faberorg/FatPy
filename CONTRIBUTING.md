2. **Clone Your Fork**  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/FatPy.git  # Clone your fork
```

3. **Create a Branch**  

```bash
git checkout -b my-feature-branch  # Create a new branch for your feature
```

4. **Write Tests for Your Feature**  
Define expected behavior first.
5. **Implement the Feature**

## :hammer_and_wrench: Development Setup

### Setting Up Your Environment

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/FatPy.git
cd FatPy

# Using uv (recommended)
uv venv
.venv\Scripts\activate  # On Unix: source .venv/bin/activate
uv sync
uv pip install -e .
pre-commit install

# Using pip
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # On Unix: source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pip install -e .
pre-commit install
```

For detailed configuration of your development environment, see the **[Installation Guide :arrow_right:](https://vybornak2.github.io/FatPy/development/install/#installation-guide)**

## :test_tube: Test-Driven Development

### FatPy follows Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles

   1. **Write the test first**  
       Define what the code should do before implementing it
   2. **See the test fail**  
       Run the test to confirm it fails without the implementation
   3. **Write the minimal code**  
       Implement just enough code to make the test pass
   4. **Run the test**  
       Verify the implementation meets the requirements
   5. **Refactor**  
       Clean up the code while ensuring tests still pass
   6. **Repeat**  
       Use the same principles for next feature

For more details, see the **[Testing Guide :arrow_right:](https://vybornak2.github.io/FatPy/development/testing/)**

### Run tests regularly

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/core/test_specific_module.py

# Test with coverage
pytest --cov=src/fatpy --cov-report=html
```

## :computer: Coding Standards

FatPy aims for high code quality utilizing these tools:

- **Ruff**  - Linting and formatting for consistent code style.
- **MyPy**  - Static type checking for reliability.
- **Pre-commit** - Automated checks before commits.

Follow our coding standards for contributions, see **[Code Style Guide :arrow_right:](https://vybornak2.github.io/FatPy/development/code_style/)**  

### Running Code Quality Checks

```bash
# Run linting
ruff check .

# Apply fixes automatically
ruff check --fix .

# Format code
ruff format .

# Run type checking
mypy .

# Run pre-commit on all files
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## :memo: Documentation

Keep FatPyâ€™s documentation clear and up-to-date with these guidelines:

- **API Changes**  
Update documentation for any API modifications.
- **Docstrings**  
Add docstrings following Google style to all new code.
- **Examples**  
Include examples and mathematical formulas where helpful to aid users.

Learn best practices and guidelines for documentation, see **[Documentation Guide :arrow_right:](https://vybornak2.github.io/FatPy/development/documentation/)**

### Building Documentation

```bash
# Activate project environment
.\{environment_name}\Scripts\activate

# Build and serve documentation locally
mkdocs serve
```
